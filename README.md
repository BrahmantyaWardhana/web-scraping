Scraping meat-seafod information data from a [grocery store](https://www.jewelosco.com/aisle-vs/meat-seafood/meat-essentials.html?sort=price)

## TODO

[x] learn how to use beautiful soup

[x] try to simply print out scraped data

[x] deal with pagination on webpage

[] try to get more than just name of items (get mult variables)

[] prep data for analysis or visualization (put into df and possibly import to csv)

[] gather all relevant data for analysis

[] create visualization of the data
